                  When scaling to the European market, the streaming platform faced a challenge in increasing customer retention and converting more users from free trials to paid subscriptions. Specifically, the conversion rate in Poland of users who opted for the 14-day trial for 1zł indicated a need to improve the user experience and make the transition to paid plans seamless.

                In 2023, Blik was the top choice for digital payments in Poland, chosen by 78% of respondents. Card payments and e-wallets followed as next popular options.
              </span>
              <span class="body">
               The security when it comes to financial payments was the second most important benefit of subscription services perceived by respondents in Poland in 2019.
              </span>
              <span class="body">
                 From 2022 to 2023, the trend remains stable in Poland, as users perceive high value in affordable pricing as one of the top reasons to pay for the subscription.
              </span>
              <span class="body">
               In 2022, a third of Polish respondents who hadn't subscribed in the last 12 months stated the dislike of commitments as the main barrier to making a purchase.
              </span>
               <span class="body">
               Access to lots of channels is the main driver for purchasing TV subscription, chosen by 61% of Polish respondents in 2023.

            <div class="container1">
              <span class="body">
                  In the current system, the "Sign In" button was confusing as it led to both sign-in and sign-up flows in the same modal window. To improve the UX, I suggested separating the two actions and making the sign-up process a full-screen to eliminate distractions.
                </span>
                 <span class="body">
                  Also, I introduced the SSO (Single-Sign-On) option, so that the user could log into multiple connected systems (e.g. app, website, TV) simultaneously.
 </span>
              <span class="body">
                 In the UI, I emphasized the importance of alternate sign-up options to give users flexibility.
   </span>
               <span class="body">
                 Lastly, I suggested such UX Writing improvements: replace “Sign In" with the “Log in” to omit confusion when differentiating from the “Sign Up”; make CTA actionable by changing it from the “Phone Number” to “Enter Phone Number”; change the promotional text in this step from information on how many users already joined the platform, to the copy that brings more attention to the value proposition.

                Audience research that pays for a TV subscription opens the opportunity to expand by showcasing the value proposition.
              </span>
              <span class="body">
                From that UXR finding key suggestions were to highlight the perk of TV channels amount, bring more attention to the high video quality and accent on premieres’ brands.
I renamed plans to better resonate with value that customers get (from S/L/M to Starter/Prime/Elite).
              </span>
              <span class="body">
                  I’ve also used the classic approach: the plan that is most profitable* is situated in the middle. In such cases “profitable” doesn’t always mean it is the most expensive for customers.
                </span>
                 <span class="body">
                  I’ve added the label to highlight the video quality perk and moved repetitive secondary perks from plans’ cards to the detailed view.
              </span>
              <span class="body">
              Based on research by Ortega & Tabares (2023), the price ending in .99 is unconsciously more affordable. However, affordable and luxury do not align well, so to sell higher-quality service .00 pricing is better.
That’s why for the “Elite” (earlier “L”) subscription I suggested removing odd-even pricing.

            <div class="container1">
              <span class="body">
                The importance of secondary data in UXR is in its wider reach that helps contextualize your research and ensure the effort is justified. There is internal secondary data like tracking, and external such as industry reports and so on. However one should not solely rely on the external secondary data itself, checking already available sources of information is feasible, time-saving and often free or cheaper than running a study.
              </span>
              <span class="body">
                Anyways not any piece of information is useful so to differentiate if it is, you can ask yourself these questions:
                <br> Is this information relevant to your research? In general like demographics and in other ways as for example if their questions were too specific.

                  <br> Is the source reliable? Which methods did they use and were they properly applied? I wouldn’t recommend relying on others’ qualitative research findings ever, as the chance it really works for your specific research need is at its lowest. 

                         <br> Were there enough participants for data to be considered quantitative? Even if the study is called quantitative but the respondents amount is small then the answers are considered random or accidental.
                       
                  <br> Is it outdated? Not always being outdated is regarding the year of when study was published, but more about the lived context influenced by external factors.
