                Locatour is a mobile application that provides personalised
                traveling recommendations in the form of user-generated "fast
                content". This social network enables travelers to join
                communities and exchange useful information.

              <span class="body">
                Would be available on iOS and Android, the app is an audiovisual
                recommendation system for travelers providing them with
                real-time updates based on Azure Stream Analytics technology.

                The target audience includes travelers who need help when
                visiting new places, users looking to change their place of
                residence, and influencers keen on sharing interesting spots.

                  The onboarding process in the app prompts users to pick a few
                  categories of interest, for which they provide reaction-based
                  feedback by liking or skipping cards (also known as swiping).
                  That allows the system to show personalised results from the
                  very beginning.

                  The content-based filtering continuously recommends results
                  with similar content to the one the user liked.

                <span>
                  Next, the collaborative filtering begins when we get to know
                  the user better and connect this information with user
                  ratings. Leveraging the user-to-user approach, the system
                  looks for dependencies between users, so the recommended
                  results (e.g. places) for a traveler are based on what other
                  similar users liked. With the item-to-item approach, we also
                  find similarities between user-generated content (e.g. shared
                  tourist attractions), then because the user likes one place
                  the other most similar will be recommended.

                The platform’s map is always up-to-date and shows open places

                It also helps to find places where the staff speaks a specific
                language (e.g. English-speaking) for those who don’t know the
                foreign language.

                  include recommendations like posting the story from the
                  visited place only after you left it, posting sensitive
                  information like departure dates is not allowed, one should

                Thriving communities are essential in Locatour. Users create

                together.

                We saw the evident need for that as people already were building

                  access, administrated. You can keep a group public, like a

They can also filter search results by type using multiple-choice chips e.g. "museum," "theatre," or by place's characteristics like "accessible," "free entrance," or "pet-friendly."
